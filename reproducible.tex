\section{Reproducibility}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Along with the final version of the paper, we will make all of the NetFPGA SUME hardware code available in an open source repository. We will include a virtual machine image with all of the necessary dependencies installed to make it easy for others to reproduce all of our simulation results.
